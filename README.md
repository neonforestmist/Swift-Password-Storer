# Swift-Password-Storer
Just a small project I did for someone :)
# How do i run/edit this?
The easiest way for a beginner i think is to just use a Swift Online Compiler such as [this](https://www.programiz.com/swift/online-compiler/) and it should be pretty easy from there.
# Want to use it for something in particular?
Sure! Go for it.
